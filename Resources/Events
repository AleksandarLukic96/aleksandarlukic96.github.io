PARKING

1. Expansion of Paid and Parking Zones
Introduction of new paid zones: In 2017, the yellow paid zone was extended to areas such as Østerbro, leading to a reduction of up to 30% in the number of parked cars in the affected areas.
Copenhagen Municipality, though perhaps it merely shifted parking to other areas?

New time-limited parking zones: Starting in 2023, 15 new zones with a three-hour time limit are being introduced in districts such as Vanløse, Amager, and Sydhavnen. The goal is to limit long-term parking by commuters and travelers.

2. In 2022, 92% of Copenhageners who both live and work in the municipality used bicycles, public transportation, or walked to and from work and study. Only 8% commuted by car within Copenhagen.

3. Designated Parking Spaces for EVs and Car-Sharing Vehicles
In 2021, the City of Copenhagen decided to convert 5,000 parking spaces to either electric vehicles (4,100 spaces) or car-sharing vehicles (900 spaces) as part of the green transition.

5. Covid-19’s Impact on Parking Patterns
During the pandemic, the number of parking fines dropped significantly due to remote work and fewer cars in the city. In 2022, levels returned to normal with over 300,000 fines issued.

LEGISLATION

1. Emission-Based Parking Permit Pricing (2020)
In an effort to discourage the use of high-emission vehicles, Copenhagen significantly increased the cost of residential parking permits for petrol and diesel cars. For instance, permits for low-emission vehicles rose from 10 DKK to 1,000 DKK annually, while those for higher-emission vehicles increased to 4,000 DKK. Conversely, permits for electric and hydrogen vehicles remained relatively low at 200 DKK per year.
