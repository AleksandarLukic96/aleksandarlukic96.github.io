  <h2>Parking</h2>
  <p>
    Before diving into why parking seems to be difficult to find in Copenhagen, we should first ascertain whether parking opportunities have actually been diminishing. 
    The idea is simple: <strong>if the the number of parking spaces are decreasing, parking should be harder to find</strong>. <br> So, let's looks at a simple graph of total street parking spaces in Copenhagen over the years.
    
  <div class="figure-text-container">
    <div class="text-block">
      From this figure, it seems like there should be <em>more</em> parking. However, for several reasons, simply having
      more parking spaces does not necessarily mean that it is easier to find parking. Maybe the increase in parking
      spaces is not keeping up with the increase in cars. So, instead let's investigate the <em>mean occupancy</em> â€“
      meaning the percentage of used parking at a given street in the city.

    <div class="plot-container">
      <img src="../assets/figures/mean occupancy bar.png" alt="Bar Occupancy" class="iframe"></img>
    </div>
    
    Again, this figure does not show the whole picture. On the surface, it seems like there are always parking available and the occupancy even seems to have decreased the last six years. Still, showing the mean for the whole city can be misleading and is perhaps not the best pointer to finding parking opportunities. Perhaps, if we explored the district individually, we would see patterns in the city. 
    To explore the mean occupancy for the different districts, use the filter button on the following visualisation.

      <iframe src="../assets/figures/interactive_occupancy_plot.html" class="iframe"
      style="min-height: 460px;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>
    
    Looking at this, the problem is obviously a bit nuanced. Some districts (like Valby) have low occupancy, but that is not going to help you if you are looking for a parking spot at Vesterbro in the evening.
    But even at Vesterbro, there should be some parking available, so what could result in people not being able to find parking?
    In the next tab we will take a look at why available parking does not neccesarily mean that it is easy to find parking.
